## Bonus Exercises

In this folder we provide further (larger) exercises that consist in modelling real world protocols. The goal of the exercises is to learn how you can apply Tamarin (from scratch!) to actual problems.

We do not provide skeleton files for these protocols, but do ask us if you have any questions while (or after) modelling!

In particular we provide the following exercises:

* **OAuth 2.0**,  taken from [this other Tamarin workshop](https://github.com/felixlinker/tamarin-workshop).

* A simplified version of the **EMV** (in particular Visa) protocol.


You may of course choose whichever one(s) interests you the most!

Be warned that often a large part of modelling in Tamarin consists in getting familiar with the specification of the protocol to be modelled. In particular, these two exercises have rather large specifications.

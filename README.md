Tamarin Prover Tutorial for the 2024 Summer School on real-world crypto and privacy, Vodice, Croatia

Please install the Tamarin-prover before the start of the tutorial (happening on Monday). 
You will find information on how to install it in our [Installation Guide](https://github.com/sgiampietro/tamarin-tutorial/blob/main/installation/InstallationGuide.md). 


## Material

* The folders `sessionX` contain exercises for the respective sessions. (Note that the first session will consist in a lecture and demo). 
* This [cheatsheet](https://github.com/felixlinker/tamarin-workshop/blob/main/cheatsheet.md) from another Tamarin workshop (by Felix Linker) is a good summary of Tamarin's syntax.
* In case you have any doubts or questions on the syntax and usage of Tamarin, the [Tamarin manual](https://tamarin-prover.com/manual/master/book/001_introduction.html) is available online and is a great source of information.
* Cas Cremers created a helpful illustration (`dependencygraph.pdf`) of Tamarin's GUI output.
